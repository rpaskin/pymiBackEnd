# PymiBot - Dispute facts with your friends!

This is the PUC-Rio Team's repo for a Global Editors/ Globo Lab Hackathon in Sao Paulo, April 2018 project.

This is a starter Ruby on Rails back end with CRUD frameworks for Categories, Verdicts, Fact Checkers and News, as well as RESTful services for all of that.
